# DeadsOverthrow
Dead's Overthrow is a mod for the widely popular military simulator ARMA 3. This mod started as a port of Gearheart's Martial Law, which in itself was a port of the now-discontinued and open-source Overthrow mod. Since then, hundreds of hours of effort have gone into improving the original mod, taking it in its original direction, and building upon the original principles to create a unique gaming experience.

Simply put, Dead's Overthrow hopes to combine the open world, and asymmetrical guerilla warfare action of the original Overthrow, and introduce a meaningful economic simulation on top of it, requiring cooperation to capitalize on a market that responds to the player's actions.

## Main Features of this mod:
* The economy and Blufor opposition react dynamically to the player's actions. Completing civilian jobs (Personal transport, item delivery, trucking jobs, etc.) can earn the player a tidy sum while improving the stability of the nation, affecting prices, and lowering BLUFORs guard.
* Alternatively, being a menace and spurring the resistance by completing jobs for other powers present on the island, committing hit-and-run attacks, and sabotaging infrastructure will cause stability to drop, stressing local economies, and causing the BLUFOR army to respond in force.
* Players can invest their funds into either weapons and recruits for the defiant, or businesses and resources for the entrupenural, to expand their power, and potentially compete against the tyrannical overlord of the nation for power and popularity.
* A staple of the original overthrow, now much, much grander battles are waged for every inch of land. Expect a well-armed, and intelligent BLUFOR adversary when capturing key objectives. Be warned that as your influence grows, so does the old government.

## What is changed from the source:
* Reworked economy logic, heavily rewards capitalizing on high stability, and profiteering off low stability towns.
* Drastic changes to prices, progression, and resources, it will take a lot of effort to go from owning a measly slum to operating a fleet of tanks and jets and require aligning yourself with another power present in the old nation.
* A long list of bug fixes: performance optimizations, resolved exploits, unfinished features completed, and AI corrections are just the start of the QOL changes made.
* UI overhauls, making obscure information easier to understand, and better explaining the features available in the game.
* Many, many, more changes, features, and otherwise from the original Overthrow.

### To Do:
* Add ability to "place" weapons (I.e for weapon racks.)
* Rework talk to UI to use more modern Arma3 features
* Add furniture to NPC houses
* Add "Auto loadout" to player squad members if near warehouse. Will cause them to automatically take a helmet, vest, primary weapon, and ammo from warehouse.
* Add ability for NATO to bag dead bodies after so long.
* Virtualize NATO convoys, ect. Have their route predicated as a path, and use time and speed to predict where they will be. If the convoy gets close to a player, physically spawn it in.
